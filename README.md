This repository contains the model definition of "DeepHistoClass: A novel strategy for confident classification of immunohistochemistry images using Deep Learning" implementation -  a Bayesian deep learning model intended for cell type-specific protein expression image classification.

Installation: Required dependencies: Python 3

Dataset:
JPEG files of all 7,848 images of the HPA dataset used in the present investigation, as well as the manually annotated protein expression in eight different cell types are available on v20.proteinatlas.org. Manual errors identified as part of this study have been corrected, which means that some of the presented protein expression data on the HPA will differ from the input data used for model training. All images from the independent dataset from another laboratory have been uploaded to the BioStudies repository (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies) under the accession S-BSST554.
